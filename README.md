# Shaped
Shaped is a fun javascript application where users can create elegant murals using 6 wooden shapes. All of the shapes fit together in someway which results in endless pattern possibilities. Get creative!
## Live Demo
## Features
* Users are greeted with a modal on how to play the game. Once the modal closes, the information can be accessed again by clicking the "?" button.

## Technologies

* Vanilla Javascript
* HTML Canvas

## Future Functionalities
* Due to the short timeline of creating this project, there are a handful of features I would love to implement in the near future. Some of those features are:
  * Allowing users to save their artwork.
  * Implementing a button that spins artwork as a whole.
  * Allowing users to change the colors of the shapes.
